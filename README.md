# auto-doc

AutoDoc is an automatic document processing project. It was developed to help me process over 5000 pages of customer information for marketing and analysis.
This program was designed specifically for this project. I plan on continuing the development of this project. Eventually it will be a full fledged application to assist in document processing. Ideally it would function with minimal changes required between projects. I am also looking to move away from Python as other languages would be more suitable.

Since its development this project has been used to process over 20,000 documents. I will be updating this project over the next few months, aiming for a full update in the spring of 2021. Before moving away from Python, the update will focus on organization and automation management.
