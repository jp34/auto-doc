# auto-doc

AutoDoc is an automatic document processing project. It was developed to help me process over 5000 pages of customer information for marketing and analysis.
This program was designed specifically for this project. In its current state it would need to be reformated to be used in another project.

I plan on continuing the development of this project. Eventually it will be a full fledged application to assist in document processing. Ideally it would function with minimal changes required between projects. I am also looking to move away from Python as other languages would be more suitable.
